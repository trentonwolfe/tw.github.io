Hello! My name is Trenton Wolfe. I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Montana State University in beautiful Bozeman, Montana. I'm in the Department of Microbiology & Cell Biology and work in Dr. Seth Walk's lab. My research focuses on understanding how the bacteria in our gut (i.e., our gut microbiome) can protect us from environmental toxins like arsenic. I also have some side projects focusing on *Clostridioides difficile*, gut microbiome differences in IBD patients, and I often collaborate with ZBiotics on some of their projects. 


üìñ My Story
======
I was born and raised in Anaconda, Montana ‚Äî a small town nestled in the mountains, rich in natural beauty and history, but also shaped by decades of mining and smelting. Growing up, I didn‚Äôt just hear about environmental pollution ‚Äî I lived it. In middle and high school, I participated in the BRIC (Bringing Research Into the Classroom) project based at Montana Tech, where I collaborated with scientists from the Clark Fork Watershed Education Program [CFWEP](https://cfwep.org). We ventured out to local ‚Ñπ sites along the Upper Clark Fork River, collecting data on riparian habitats and assessing the progress of EPA-led cleanup efforts. 

It was through this work that I first realized how tailings and smelter waste had not only shaped the local environment, but also the health and identity of our community -  and the downstream communities in places like Missoula. Those early field sparked something in me. As we then learned how to collect soil and water samples to isolate bacteria and bacteriophages, I discovered a fascination with the unseen microbial world. What started as a fun field trip in middle and high school became the seed of a lifelong passion for science, ultimately leading me to where I am today

As a PhD candidate in Microbiology and Immunology at Montana State University-Bozeman, I investigate how the gut microbiome influences our body's response to toxic exposures. My long-term aspirations from my work are to bring insights into how we can better protect communities like my hometown, Anaconda ‚Äî and other places across the globe. 

Outside the lab, I find balance by immersing myself in the natural spaces that first inspired me (of which Montana is in high supply). Whether I'm skiing, hiking, paddle boarding, or floating the river, reconnecting with nature helps recharge my mind and keep me grounded in why I do this work.
